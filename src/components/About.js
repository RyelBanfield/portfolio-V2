      <h1>About Me üë®‚Äçü¶±</h1>
      <p>A Web Developer with an entrepreneurial mindset, a love for problem solving and ambitions of seeing the world while working remotely.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for technology and innovation, and I'm always thinking about the future of tech. I take pride in a job well done and always strive for perfection. With my ability to stay on track with minimal supervision, I can meet deadlines and deliver expected results while integrating easily into teams with people from anywhere in the world. I wake up every day looking forward to learning new things and working with motivated and successful teams from around the world.</p>
      <p>During my time at my coding Bootcamp, I have spent more than 6 months waking up at 2:30 am, meeting with my remote team at 3:00 am and then spending the next 8 hours developing my technical and non-technical skills. I have worked on Front and Back-end projects using JavaScript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails and other frameworks to build real-world projects through pair-programming. I chose to work at these hours as a challenge for myself and have successfully overcome any difficulties that have come my way because of this choice.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I have developed and improved my professional skills as a communicator and listener, as an active team member, collaborator, and mentor. This has allowed me to gain experience and have the opportunity to work, contribute, and learn remotely with programmers and teams worldwide.</p>
